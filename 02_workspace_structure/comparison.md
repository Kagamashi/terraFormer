## **Comparison: Directory-Based vs. Workspaces vs. Git Branching**

| Feature                      | Directory-Based Approach  | Workspaces Approach       | Git Branching Approach |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **State Isolation**          | ✅ Full isolation       | ⚠️ Shared backend        | ✅ Full isolation per branch |
| **Code Duplication**         | ❌ Can be high          | ✅ Minimal                | ✅ Minimal |
| **Per-Environment Customization** | ✅ Full control      | ❌ Limited               | ✅ Full control |
| **Ease of Management**       | ❌ Requires more setup  | ✅ Easier to switch       | ❌ Requires manual branch switching |
| **Best For**                 | Complex setups, teams  | Small projects, quick setups | CI/CD pipeline automation |
