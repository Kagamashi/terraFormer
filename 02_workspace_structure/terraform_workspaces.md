
## **Terraform Workspaces Approach**
Terraform **workspaces** allow a single configuration to manage multiple environments by maintaining multiple state files within the same directory.

### **Example Usage:**
```bash
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace new staging
terraform workspace new prod
terraform workspace select dev
```

### **Code Example:**
```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-app-${terraform.workspace}"
}
```

### **Pros:**
✅ **No code duplication** – all environments share the same configuration.
✅ Easier maintenance with **less overhead**.
✅ Quick switching between environments (`terraform workspace select dev`).
✅ Useful for **small-scale** projects that need logical environment separation.

### **Cons:**
❌ **State isolation is limited** – all environments share the same backend.
❌ Can cause conflicts in **remote backends** if used improperly.
❌ Less flexibility in configuring per-environment settings (e.g., different providers, RBAC, IAM policies).
